//make a toString for Warriors/Mages/Rangers so that the code in outputs can be cut down when the user chooses to display their character information.
//Look at creating an overloaded enemy constructor so that enemies can eventually be higher levels.
//Maybe see if the blacksmith will allow the player to increase their weapon strength (aka prestige their weapon) after reaching level 5 and obtaining enough gold.
